**Project Background**
After graduation, I wanted to continue working on my Checkers project. However, I noticed that the original code was messy, hard to read, and did not adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. To address these issues, I decided to rewrite the project from scratch. This time, I focused on writing clean, clear code and following OOP rules.

Over the course of 5 days, dedicating 4 hours each day, I meticulously redesigned and reimplemented the project. The result is a more robust, maintainable, and understandable Checkers game. This new version not only follows best practices in software development but also enhances the overall structure and functionality of the game.

Key improvements include:

  -Clear Class Structure: The project now has well-defined classes for the board, pieces, game logic, and players.

  -Improved Readability: The code is organized with meaningful names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain.

I am excited to share this improved version and look forward to any feedback or contributions from the community.

Feel free to tweak this further as per your preferences!
