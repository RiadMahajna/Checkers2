**Project Background**

After graduation, I wanted to continue working on my Checkers project. However, I noticed that the original code was messy, hard to read, and did not adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. To address these issues, I decided to rewrite the project from scratch. This time, I focused on writing clean, clear code and following OOP rules.

After 5 days of work, dedicating 4 hours each day, I am pleased to present the improved version of the Checkers project.

Key improvements include:

  -Clear Class Structure: The project now has well-defined classes for the board, pieces, game logic, and players.

  -Improved Readability: The code is organized with meaningful names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain.

I am excited to share this improved version and look forward to any feedback or contributions from the community.

Feel free to tweak this further as per your preferences!
